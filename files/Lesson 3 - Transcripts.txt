We all know that exercise and diet are very important for our health.
However, another really important way to stay healthy is to get plenty of sunshine.
When sunlight hits our skin, we turn it into Vitamin D.
Vitamin D is super important for staying healthy.
People who have low levels of Vitamin D have higher rates of illness, such as cancer, bone problems, heart disease, and even the common cold.
Did you know that humans spend less time in the sun today than at any point in human history?
It’s true!
Due to modern city life, people spend more time indoors than ever before.
Also, the companies who sell sun-block cream influence us to cover our skin in chemicals, preventing us from getting natural Vitamin D.
The point is, most of us aren’t getting enough vitamin D to stay strong and healthy.
Of course, we have to be careful not to get a sunburn (which can also cause skin cancer), but we should all try to get a good dose of sunshine on our skin each day, especially in the winter months.
Best of all, sunshine is free and it feels good on our skin.
So get out and spend more time in the sun.
It’s a great way to stay healthy.
Here’s a cute video on the benefits of Vitamin D.
Enjoy…
